\label{sub:how_can_the_performance_of_a_nas_be_affected_by_the_tcp_windows_size}
	The \emph{TCP window size} is the maximum amount of data
	that can be sent at any time over a TCP connection.
	After the definded amount of data has been sent,
	the sender has to wait for the receivers acknowledgement
	to send more data.
	The receiver acknowledges the acctual received amount of bytes,
	so that the sender can send the difference to the window sizes.
	This is done to ensure that all packages have arrived at the receiver.

	If the value of the \emph{TCP window size} is too low,
	the overall throuhput of the network might be lower than possible.
	Theoretically the \emph{TCP window size} should be set to:
	\begin{equation}
		available\ bandwith * round\ trip\ time = TCP\ window\ size
	\end{equation}
