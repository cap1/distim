\subsection{Why does the lossy nature of standart Ethernet make it unsuitable for a layered FCoE implementation? How does CEE address this problem?} % (fold)

	Standard Ethernet is lossy,
	which allows frames to be dropped or lost in transmission.
	Usually higher level protocols like TCP take care of the correct order of transmission,
	but they are not present in FCoE and would lead to a large overhead.

	The following technologies are part of CEE to prevent packet loss in FCoE environments:\\
	\emph{Priority-based Flow Control} (PFC) makes use of the IEEE 802.3X Ethernet PAUSE control frame.
	This frame is send by the receiver if his buffers are full,
	to notify the sender and make him stop sending packets
	so that no packet is lost
	As the PAUSE control frame blocks the communication on the entire link,
	PFC creates eight seperate virtual links to prevent a single full buffer from blocking
	all the communication.

	\emph{Congestion Notification} allows the receivin FCoE switches to tell the sender to
	reduce the data transfer rate.
	These notifications are route backwars to the data stream so that the host can limit the rate.
