	\subsubsection{Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:mean_time_between_failure}
		It is the average time available for system or component
		to perform its normal operations between failures expressed in hours.
	% subsubsection mean_time_between_failure_ (end)

	\subsubsection{Mean Time To Recover (MTTR)} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:mean_time_to_recover}
		Describes the time to required to repair a failed component.
		It includes the time it takes to detect the fault,
		until it is fully resolved
		and the system is running again.

	\subsubsection{Information Availability} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:availability}
		Information Availability (IA) is the time period during
		which a system is in condition to perform its intendet function.
		It can be described with system up- and downtime \ref{eq:IA_system}
		or with MTBF and MTTR \ref{eq:IA_MTBF_MTTR}.
		
		\begin{equation}
			IA = system\ uptime/(system uptime + system downtime)
		\end{equation}
		\label{eq:IA_system}

		\begin{equation}
			IA = MTBF/(MTBF + MTTR)
		\end{equation}
		\label{eq:IA_MTBF_MTTR}
