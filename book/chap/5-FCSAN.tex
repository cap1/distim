\subsection{What is zoning?} % (fold)
\label{sub:what_is_zoning}
	Zoning is an FC switch function
	that enables node ports within the fabric to be logically segmented
	into groups and to communicate with each other within the group.

	Whenever a change takes place in the name server database,
	the fabric controller sends a Rgeistered State Change Notification(RSCN)
	to all the nodes impacted.
	This can generated large amounts of fabric-management traffic,
	which might impact host-to-storrage traffic.
	With enabled zoning,
	only the affected nodes in a zone get the RSCN from the fabric.

\subsubsection{Where is WWN zoning preferred over port zoning?} % (fold)
\label{ssub:where_is_wwn_zoning_preferred_over_port_zoning}
	A setup where parts are regularily moved
	and new targets are added.

\subsubsection{Where is port zoning preferred over WWN zoning?} % (fold)
\label{ssub:where_is_port_zoning_preferred_over_wwn_zoning}
	In a setup where targets will not be switched
	but be replaced in case of failure.
	Long time Archiving might be a usecase.

\subsection{Describe the process of assigning an FC address to a node when logging into a network for the first time!} % (fold)
\label{sub:describe_the_process_of_assigning_an_fc_address_to_a_node_when_logging_into_a_network_for_the_first_time}
	This process is called \emph{fabric login}(FLOGI) which is performed between an N and a F_Port.
	To log on o the fabric the node sends a FLOGI frame with its WWNN and WWPN parameters
	to the login service at the predefined FC address \texttt{FFFFFE} (Fabric Login Server).
	The service accepts the login with an Accept (ACC) frame
	which includes the assigned FC address for the node.
	Now the node registers itself with the local Name Server on the switch,
	with its WWNN, WWPN, port type, class of service and assigned FC address.
	After loging in the N_Port can query the name server database for information
	about all other logged in ports.
