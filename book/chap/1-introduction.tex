	The content of data bases is structured information,
	as a computer can deduce information from the data.
	Single datafields have relations with each other
	and they are described in a machine readable manner.

	Unstructured is basically everything else,
	like images, pdf files, or html pages.
	Images can be (easily) interpreted by a machine,
	html, xml and excel sheet can be semi-structured.
