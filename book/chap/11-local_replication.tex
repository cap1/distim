	The easiest way to ensure consistency when performing a replication
	is to hold all I/O to the data.
	This is not always possible as,
	request might time out.
	However one can be sure that at the end of the replication,
	the data is correctly replicated.
	If this technique is applicable depends on the time it
	takes to perform the replication.

	As I/O depends usually on a previous set of I/Os
	it is also possible to capture all I/Os that occurred during the replication.
	These I/Os are then also performed on the replica.
	This ensures that data is still accessible and writable,
	but the replica equals the data at the point in time
	when the replica is finished.
	One has to make sure to perform all dependent I/Os
	and apply them in the correct order.
