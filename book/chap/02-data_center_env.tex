	It is easier to generate backups and its capacity can be changed much faster.
	Virtualization also hast the benefit,
	that changes inside the data center are transparent to entities using the virtual data center.
	It also enhances availability as in case of failures,
	backup systems can be deployed more easily.

		\item[HVAC] \hfill\\
			Used to control temperature  and humidity in a data center.
			Recommended temperatures range from 15 to 24Â°C
			and humidity between 40 and 55\%.
			Accounts for the energy used in the data center.
		\item[Power supplies] \hfill \\
			Power makes about one quarter TCO of a data center.
			It is important for business continuity to have redundant supplies in cases of failuers.
			Usually batteries and generators are installed on site
			to ensure that no data is lost in case of a power outage.
		\item[Security] \hfill \\
			It is important to restrict physical access to the data center,
			as data can also be stolen physically.
			Of course the servers must be secure at the end of the day.
