\subsection{When is object-based storage a better choice then SAN and NAS?} % (fold)
\label{sub:when_is_object_based_storage_a_better_choice_then_san_and_nas}
	Object-based storage is especially suitable for unstructured data.
	It combines benefits from SAN and NAS,
	and provides a platform, location independent and scalable
	environement that allows data-sharing.
